PACKAGING SUGGESTIONS FOR DJVIEW4
=================================


The makefile provides fine grain installation targets. In fact, 
 # make install 
is equivalent to
 # make install-djview install-nsdejavu install-desktop

These three targets are discussed below.



1) MAKE INSTALL-DJVIEW
----------------------

The command 
 # make install-djview
installs the djview4 binary as ${bindir}/djview4
the djview4 man page as ${mandir}/man1/djview4.1
and the translation files in ${datadir}/djvu/djview4.

It also creates (but does not overwrite) symbolic links
named ${bindir}/djview and ${mandir}/man1/djview.1
pointing to ${bindir}/djview4 and ${mandir}/man1/djview4.1
respectively. These symbolic links can be advantageously
by alternatives on system that support alternatives
such as debian or fedora.


2) MAKE INSTALL-NSDEJAVU
------------------------

The command
 # make install-nsdejavu
installs the djvu browser plugin as ${plugindir}/nsdejavu.so
and its man page ${mandir}/man1/nsdejavu.1.
Variable ${plugindir} defaults to ${libdir}/netscape/plugins,
which may or may not be appropriate for the target system.

Note that these installs conflict with the files
nsdejavu.so and nsdejavu.1 installed by DjVuLibre.
This is not a severe problem since these files are identical,
but this calls for a packaging decision.

Both the rpm spec file and the debian package provided
with the djview4 source code assume that the nsdejavu 
files will be provided by the djvulibre package(s).

Debian splits djvulibre itself into many packages
(library, development files, tools, viewer, browser plugin)
while the djvulibre rpm spec files constructs a single 
binary package. Since the djview4 viewer is slated
to replace the djview3 viewer that comes with DjVuLibre,
the debian approach seems superior.



3) MAKE INSTALL-DESKTOP
-----------------------

The command 
 # make install-desktop
installs the shell script register-djview-menu and its 
data files in directory ${datadir}/djvu/djview4/desktop/.

This shell script can be used in postinstall and prerm/preun
scripts to register xdg menu entries for djview4.
This script assumes that you have the xdg portland tools
xdg-icon-resource and xdg-desktop-menu installed.
